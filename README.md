# Spline Curve Editor
**Name**
**Gabriel Caldwell**

**Structure**
The code I developed can be found in \
*assignments/a3-splines/ACurveEditor.cpp* \
*libsrc/animation/AInterpolator-basecode.cpp*.

**Description**
This spline curve editor was created for one of my Computer Animation labs at Swarthmore College. I implemented functions to calculate control points for Catmul-Rom and Hermite Splines respectively. Additionally, I developed functions to interpolate a point across each spline.
