# Spline Curve Editor
**Gabriel Caldwell**

**Description**

This spline curve editor was created for one of my Computer Animation labs at Swarthmore College. I implemented functions to calculate control points for Catmul-Rom and Hermite Splines respectively. Additionally, I developed functions to interpolate a point across each spline.
