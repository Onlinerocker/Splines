# Spline Curve Editor
**Name** \
Gabriel Caldwell

**Structure** \
The code I developed can be found in \
*assignments/a3-splines/ACurveEditor.cpp* \
*libsrc/animation/AInterpolator-basecode.cpp*.

**Description** \
This spline curve editor was created for one of my Computer Animation labs at Swarthmore College. I implemented functions to calculate control points for Catmul-Rom and Hermite Splines respectively. Additionally, I developed functions to interpolate a point across each spline.
